Start your day with intention and clarity
Write down three goals you want to accomplish
Avoid multitasking; focus on one task at a time
Use short breaks to refresh your energy
Minimize distractions like notifications and noise
Keep your workspace clean and organized
Track your progress and celebrate small wins
Donâ€™t forget to take care of your health
Sleep nutrition and exercise impact productivity
Consistency is more powerful than motivation alone
