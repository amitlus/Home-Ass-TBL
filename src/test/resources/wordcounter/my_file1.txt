Nature is all around us offering beauty and balance
The forest breathes life into the planet providing oxygen and shelter
Birds sing rivers flow and trees dance with the wind
Insects buzz between petals pollinating flowers in their silent labor
Mountains stand still watching over valleys below
Rain falls gently feeding the thirsty earth
Sunlight filters through leaves casting patterns on the ground
Each season brings its own magic  colors sounds and feelings
Humans are part of nature not separate from it
Respecting the natural world ensures our survival
