Today started off quiet with soft rain tapping on the windows
I brewed a cup of coffee and read a chapter from my book
Time felt slow peaceful  like the world had paused
By noon the clouds parted and sunlight warmed the balcony
I stepped outside and watched birds hopping across the railing
There was a sense of stillness a kind of calm I hadn't felt in weeks
Later I sketched for a while losing track of time
Dinner was simple: pasta tea and quiet music
Evening came quickly and I lit a candle before bed
It was a good day gentle and full in its own way
